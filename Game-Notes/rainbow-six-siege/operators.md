# Operators to Main in Siege
Operators I'm willing to main that bring value to the team.

>The category they are listed under will be what I go to when I need to fulfill a specific role in a team composition. The sub categories alongside an operator will represent the role that operator usually takes on.

>If an operator is listed as a sub bulletin for another operator, they are considered an alternative for that operator.
