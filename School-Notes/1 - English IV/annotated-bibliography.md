## Source 1 - The Daily Texan
Starr, R. (2013). Science Scene: JFK assassination a conspiracy of one. The Daily Texan. https://thedailytexan.com/2013/11/21/science-scene-jfk-assassination-a-conspiracy-of-one/

This article considers if it was possible for Lee Harvey Oswald to have been able to make all 3 shots on the day of JFK's assassination. Robert claims that the first bullet missed, and that there was enough time between the rest of the shots for it to be possible. The article then disproves popular theories that insinuate that there were more than 3 shots, and/or that shots were made from another person.

Robert Starr is a reputable person. He is a teaching assistant at the University of Texas at Austin. The Daily Texan itself is student run but approved by the school. Their bias is debated on if it's left or right leaning. The article was published in 2013. Considering the age of the JFK assassination, 2013 is rather recent.

This article clears up confusion about the counter argument to my claim. It was definitely possible for Oswald to have fired 3 accurate shots in quick succession at the moving car. The problem is that I believe there were more than 3 shots and another shooter on that day. If that is true, then it is physically impossible for a bolt action rifle to be fired in that amount of time, let alone accurately.


## Source 2 - Live Science
Lallanilla, M. (2013, November 20). What Is the Single-Bullet Theory? Livescience.com; Live Science. https://www.livescience.com/41369-single-bullet-theory-jfk-assassination.html

This article describes the support and criticism for what is known as the "Magic Bullet Theory." It covers the amount of bullets, trajectory of said bullets, and as well as the Zapruder film. It stays neutral on the subject, and merely shows the main pieces of evidence for or against the theory.

Marc Lallanilla and Live Science are both reputable sources that can be trusted. The article was posted in 2013 which is fairly recent, especially considering the age of the JFK assassination as well as there being no new recent developments in the conspiracy.

This helps look at the Magic Bullet Theory objectively. One singular bullet is believed to have gone through the back of JFK's neck, gone through the governor's back, hit the governor's arm, and finally end up the the governor's knee. All of that was supposedly done with one bullet that was virtually unscathed when recovered in the aftermath. This article helps prove the absurdity that even if everything the CIA claimed happened that day was true, the bullet's trajectory is very unlikely.
