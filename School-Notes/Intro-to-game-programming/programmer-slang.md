# The 4 Core Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming

- **Encapsulation:** Controlling the data that a method imports and exports, and organizing it through methods like getters and setters

- **Abstraction:** Forgoing the implementation  of a feature, only remembering what the feature does

- **Polymorphism:** Overloading a method to have one command perform multiple things

- **Inheritance:** Having a child class of a parent class.
