The Sinusoidal Relationship I chose is: **The Time Sunrise occurs on the 1st Day of Every Month in Phoenix for 2023**

## Data: 1st Day of the Month over Time of Sunrise (minutes multiplied by 60)
| Day | Time of Sunrise |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| 1 | 7.53 |
| 2 | 7.4 |
| 3 | 6.93 |
| 4 | 6.26 |
| 5 | 5.66 |
| 6 | 5.32 |
| 7 | 5.37 |
| 8 | 5.67 |
| 9 | 6.03 |
| 10 | 6.37 |
| 11 | 6.77 |
| 12 | 7.23 |

## Equation and Explanation
### Parts of the Trig Function
$$f(x)=1.105\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{11}x\ +\frac{2\pi}{11}\right)+6.425$$
f(x) represents the time sunrise occurs (the minutes are divided by 60 for correct graphical representation). X represents the first day of the month throughout the course of 2023.

The equation is in radians. The period is over the course of a year. \

### Domain and Range
Domain: x is the first days of a month in the year, so $1 ≤ x ≤ 12$

Range: y is the timestamp for sunrise, so $5.32 ≤ y ≤ 7.53$

## Why Would This be Important to Study
The obvious implication is seeing the beautiful sunset. Outside of this, sleep is very important for the human body. Soaking in sunlight is a very easy and efficent way to wake someone up. In a time and age where much time is spent indoors, keeping your internal clock in check with day and night is important. Even with a messed up sleep schedule, sitting in the sun for 10, 20, or 30 minutes can help your body subconsciously remember its day. Knowing when the sunrise can help with this phenomenon.

## Question 1 Solving for y
**When is sunrise on September 1st? (Rounded to the nearest tenth)**

The Sun will rise on September 1st at around 5:50a.m.

## Question 2 Solving for x
**On which month will the sun rise at 7:26 for the first day of the specified month?**

The month at which the sun will rise at 7:26 for the first day of said month is December
