# Insurgency Settings
Since I'm not backing up my games, it's important to note important settings I have in the event the drive data is lost. These are also noted for sensitivity conversion.


# Sensitivity [(mouse-sensitivity)](https://www.mouse-sensitivity.com/)
<!-- (insurgency rounds all numbers to the ten-thousandths) -->
Look Sensitivity: 0.1228 (low sens)    <!-- Calculated (siege -> insurgency). Used the average of vertical and horizontal hipfire sensitivities in siege. -->     
ADS Sensitivity: 1.0 (low sens)     <!-- Calculated (siege -> insurgency). -->  <!-- ADS Multiplier: 1.1459 -->
