# Features

## Temporary Singular Uses
- Divine Intervention
  > **Can only be used once. You will get another use at level 20**
  > 
  > Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.  
  > 
  > Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your [action](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_20). Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric [domain](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Cleric#toc_5) spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a [long rest](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Resting#toc_2).  
  > 
  > At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.
- Power Word Kill
> **Can only be used once**
  > 
  > You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see within range to die instantly. If the creature you chose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.
- True Resurrection
  > **Can only be used once**
  > 
  > You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature's soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.  
  > 
  > This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any [poison](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Poisons?expansion=34047#content), cures all [diseases](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Diseases?expansion=34047#content), and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs or limbs.  
  > 
  > The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature's name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.
## Channel Divinity (2)
- Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
  > As an [action](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_20), you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the [undead](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/CategoryIndex:Monsters#toc_3). Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a [Wisdom](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_29) [saving throw](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#toc_35). If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any [damage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_46).  
  > 
  > A turned creature must spend its [turns](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_5) trying to [move](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_9) as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take [reactions](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_8). For its action, it can use only the [Dash](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_23) action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the [Dodge](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_25) action.
- Channel Divinity: Harness Divine Power
  > You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you've reached in this class: 2nd level, once; 6th level, twice; and 18th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
- Channel Divinity: Touch of Death
  > Starting at 2nd level, you can use Channel Divinity to destroy another creature's life force by touch. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can use Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target. The damage equals 5 + twice your cleric level.
## Active Features
- Anti-Healing Aura (1)
- Blessed Strikes
  > You are blessed with divine might in battle. When **a creature** takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can also deal 1d8 radiant damage to **that creature**. Once you deal this damage, you can’t use this feature again until the start of your next turn.
- Death Strike
  > At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
- Glyph Fingies (1)
> When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface
> - As a table or a section of floor or wall
> - Within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest to conceal the glyph.
>   
> The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter.
> - If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
> - The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.
> 
> You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell.
> - For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed.
> - For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
> 
> You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics
> - 1. Height or weight
> - 2. Creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow. 
> - 3. Alignment
>   
> You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.
>  
> Explosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.
> 
> Spell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.
- Black Tentacles
  > Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the Duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.
  > 
  > When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be Restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already Restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.
  > 
  > A creature Restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

- Spell Distance
 > when it comes to casting spells distance wise, 60ft-120ft is 1x the spell level damage to myself. 120ft-180ft is 2x, 180ft - 240ft is 3x and so on.
# Spells

## Cantrips
- Toll The Dead
  > You point at one creature you can see within range, and the sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it for a moment. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage.

The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

  > 
  > At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
- Cure Wounds

This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a [fireball](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:fireball?expansion=34047#content).

Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.

  > 
  > On each of your [turns](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_5), you can use a [bonus action](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_6) to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what [action](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_20) the creature will take and where it will [move](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#toc_9) during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
  > 
  > The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain the control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must [cast](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells#toc_10) this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.
  > 
  > **_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a [spell slot](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells#toc_5) of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional [undead](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters#toc_3) creatures for each slot above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.
- Vampiric Touch

  > 
  > At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
- Remove Curse
  > At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's [attunement](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Magic%20Items?expansion=34047#toc_1) to the object so it can be removed or discarded.
- Mass Healing Word
  > As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on [undead](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/CategoryIndex:Monsters?expansion=34047#toc_3) or constructs.  
  >

## 4th Level Spells (3)
- Aura of Life
  > Life-preserving energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each non-hostile creature in the aura (including you) has resistance to necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum can’t be reduced. In addition, a non-hostile, living creature regains 1 hit point when it starts its turn in the aura with 0 hit points.
- Blight

The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
  > 
  > If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it. If you target a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn’t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.
  > 
  > **_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
- Death Ward
  > You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death. The first time the target would drop to 0 [hit points](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_47) as a result of taking [damage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_46), the [target](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Spells?expansion=34047#toc_23) instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends. If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spells ends.
- Banishment
  > You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another place of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.
  > 
  > If the target is native to the plane of existence you’re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
  > 
  > If the target is native to a different plane of existence that the one you’re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn’t return.

  > 
  > The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.
