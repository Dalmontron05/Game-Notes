You are able to use one of the specific power words (i forgot which one). there's a 40% chance of failure that decreases as you level up

(I feel like this one is a bit underpowered. I'd like to either change it to a bonus action or be allowed to choose between another power word besides pain or whatever the one I chose was. Maybe we can make it to where I take some damage while doing it too, and maybe the amount of damage is dependent on the CR of the target).
## Freaky Ahh Tongue
- Bonus Action
You have a long tongue that can be used to restrain somebody in place
## Thick Thighs
You never skip leg day. Your calves are a bit bigger, allowing you an additional 10ft of movement.
# Ability Ideas
## Wings
You have wings that let you glide, but not fly
## Smite
- Bonus Action
You have a glowy tattoo that makes itself visible, even through clothing and while invisible. 

As a bonus action, you embue your weapon with a smite. 
## Big Ass Feet
stomping can create a small earthquake that may stun enemies or maybe give them disadvantage on rolls (if that is too strong than maybe half movement speed cause it's a big ass stomp)
## Hallux Heel

</p>
Little hooks at the end of your feet/hooves that make attacking with them do more damage
## Dimensional/Tactical Awareness
Your Pupil is dilated and your Iris glows brightly. When you eyes aren't obstructed, you are able to see creatures through walls but you suffer significant hearing loss.

This effect doesn't work when you eyes are obstructed, like by a blindfold or a helmet visor. You can still see when your eyes are obstructed, even by your eyelids.
# Six Eyes
Your Pupil is dilated and your Iris softly glows. When you eyes aren't obstructed, you are able to see the name, resistances, ~~vulnerabilities~~, and immunities of creatures within your line of sight.

However, you are vulnerable to Psychic damage
# Piercing Blood
- action
You have small incisions throughout your arms that you can open and close at will. As an action, you can coagulate your own blood into a ball between your hands and shoot it straight up to 150ft away. This blood can piece through multiple targets at once. Using this ability damages you. The damage you take is irrecoverable until the battle ends.

Using it over a cone of a certain amount of feet makes you take more damage
- 3ft - 1d6
- 10ft - 2d6
- 20ft - 2d10
- 30ft - 3d10
