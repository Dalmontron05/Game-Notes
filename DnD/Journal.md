Notes from sessions. We're kinda like halfway through the campaign already mf gang ðŸ¥€

- Opened the lament configuration. Top side of the box had a pendant that is Raistlin's heart (Sukana finger moment). Bottom side allowed us to travel back in time to the original tavern at the very beginning of the campaign.
- We chose to go back in time to find a common catalyst between 5 different periods of time to save the timeline.
- We told the bartender that we'd kill the giant spider for free. We went in and polymorphed it into a snail for an hour.
- Current contenders for common catalyst (**has to be strong**)
	- Grendle
	- Depressed blonde at the bar (maldraq)
	- Iris's two fluffy summons
	- The Handsome Devil
	- Raslin's brother (Caramere)
	- Iomadae
	- Bartender
	- Can of soup
Next time we'll try summoning Grendle and finding a way to get out of the past.
